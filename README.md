Android for Live Facial Recognition

Goals of this app: Contextual information on people based off of facial recognition, leveraging the Luxand FaceSDK as a starting point.

Completed: Uploading trackers to Google Cloud, Downloading trackers (names retained when app is uninstalled and reinstalled), tracker ID uploading to Firebase

To Do: Test downloads with another phone, add UI elements and additional contextual info besides name, lock tracker IDs so they don't get cleared when the user logs in, add back camera functionality
